# 3. Modifying a Path

In this step we will build an animation that follows a complex path during the animation and animates the credits during the motion. MotionLayout can modify the path that a view will take between the start and the end using a KeyPosition.

After we complete this step, we'll have implemented the following animation driven by clicking on the moon.

		*MotionScene tag is used to describe the animationn for the activity.
		*Transition tag is used to describe the animation with the help of start and end state.
		*OnClick tag is used to define the event to trigger the animation.
		*ContraintSet and Constraint tag is used to define the constraints that is to be applied at the start or at the end of the animation.

	6. Run and Test the application.


All animations in MotionLayout are defined by a start and an end ConstraintSet that define what the screen looks like before the animation starts and after the animation is done. By default, MotionLayout will plot a linear path (or a straight line) between the start and end position of each view that changes position.

To build complex paths like the arc of the moon in this example, MotionLayout uses a KeyPosition to modify the path that a view takes between the start and end.

A KeyPosition modifies the path a view takes between the start and the end ConstraintSet.

It can distort the path of a view to go through a third (or fourth, or fifth, ...) point between the start and end positions. Or, it can even speed up and slow down progress along either the X or Y axis.

A KeyPosition can only change the path during the animation, it cannot change the start or the end.

The ConstraintSet will always specify the final position for the views at the start and end of the animation.

# Understanding KeyPosition Type

In the last step we used a keyPosition type of parentRelative to offset the path by 50% of the screen. The attribute keyPositionType determines how MotionLayout will modify the path according to percentX or percentY.

		<KeyFrameSet>
		   <KeyPosition
				   app:framePosition="50"
				   app:motionTarget="@id/moon"
				   app:keyPositionType="parentRelative"
				   app:percentY="0.5"
		   />
		</KeyFrameSet>
		
There are three different types of keyPosition possible: parentRelative, pathRelative, and deltaRelative. Specifying a type will change the coordinate system by which percentX and percentY are calculated.

# What is a Coordinate System?

A coordinate system gives a way to specify a point in space. They are also useful for describing a position on the screen.

MotionLayout coordinate systems are a cartesian coordinate system. This means they have an X and a Y axis defined by two perpendicular lines. The key difference between them is where on the screen the X axis goes (the Y axis is always perpendicular to the X axis).

All coordinate systems in MotionLayout use values between 0.0 and 1.0 on both the X and Y axis. They allow negative values, and values larger than 1.0. So for example, an percentX value of -2.0 would mean, go in the opposite direction of the X axis twice.

If that all sounds a bit too much like Algebra class, check out the pictures below!

# parentRelative Coordinates

[![parentRelative Coordinates](https://github.com/Vaibhav4697/AndroidUserInterface/blob/master/images/parentRelative.png)](https://github.com/Vaibhav4697/AndroidUserInterface/blob/master/documentation/3.%20Modifying%20a%20Path.md#parentRelative-coordinates)

The keyPositionType of parentRelative uses the same coordinate system as the screen. It defines (0, 0) to the top left of the entire MotionLayout, and (1, 1) to the bottom right.

You can use parentRelative whenever you want to make an animation that moves through the entire MotionLayout â€“ like the moon arc in this example.

However, if you want to modify a path relative to the motion, for example make it curve just a little bit, the other two coordinate systems are a better choice.

# deltaRelative Coordinates

[![deltaRelative Coordinates](https://github.com/Vaibhav4697/AndroidUserInterface/blob/master/images/deltaRelative.png)](https://github.com/Vaibhav4697/AndroidUserInterface/blob/master/documentation/3.%20Modifying%20a%20Path.md#deltaRelative-coordinates)

Delta is a math term for change, so deltaRelative is a way of saying "change relative." In deltaRelative coordinates(0,0) is the starting position of the view, and (1,1) is the ending position. The X and Y axes is aligned with the screen.

The X axis is always horizontal on the screen, and the Y axis is always vertical on the screen. Compared to parentRelative, the main difference is that the coordinates describe just the part of the screen in which the view will be moving.

deltaRelative is a great coordinate system for controlling the horizontal or vertical motion in isolation. For example, you could create an animation that completes just its vertical (Y) movement at 50%, and continues animating horizontally (X).

Coordinates in deltaRelative are relative to the motion of the view.

So if the view moves to the right, X will go to the right. If the view moves to the left, X will go to the left. Similarly, the Y dimension will follow the view and go up or down.

Of course, you can always use negative values or values larger than 1.0 if you want the view to bounce past the start or stop position!

The coordinates of deltaRelative will expand or shrink based on the distance the view moves in both the X and the Y direction.

So, if you have a view that doesn't move very much, or at all, in one direction, deltaRelative won't create a useful coordinate system in that direction. For example, a view that moves horizontally from the right to left will not have a useful Y axis in deltaRelative.

# pathRelative Coordinates

[![pathRelative Coordinates](https://github.com/Vaibhav4697/AndroidUserInterface/blob/master/images/pathRelative.png)](https://github.com/Vaibhav4697/AndroidUserInterface/blob/master/documentation/3.%20Modifying%20a%20Path.md#pathRelative-coordinates)

The last coordinate system in MotionLayout is pathRelative. It's quite different than the other two as the X axis follows the motion path from start to end. So (0,0) is the starting position, and (1,0) is the ending position.

Why would you want this? It's quite surprising at first glance, especially since this coordinate system isn't even aligned to the screen coordinate system.

It turns out pathRelative is really useful for a few things.
1. Speeding up, slowing down, or stopping a view during part of the animation. Since the X dimension will always match the path the view takes exactly, you can use a pathRelative KeyPosition to change which framePosition a particular point in that path is reached. So a KeyPosition at framePosition="50" with a percentX="0.1" would cause the animation to take 50% of the time to travel the first 10% of the motion.
2. Adding a subtle arc to a path. Since the Y dimension is always perpendicular to motion, changing Y will change the path to curve relative to the overall motion.
3. Adding a second dimension when deltaRelative won't work. For completely horizontal and vertical motion, deltaRelative will only create one useful dimension. However, pathRelative will always create usable X and Y coordinates.

It's important to note that pathRelative will always define a coordinate system in terms of the motion, not of the screen.

This means it may be at an angle to the overall screen. If you need to modify the horizontal or vertical motion in terms of screen coordinates, one of the other coordinate systems is a better choice.
